login="bob');-- " 
password="howdy" 

this injection alters the SQL query as follows:

> SELECT ID, name, locale, lastlogin, gender, 
> FROM USERS_TABLE 
> WHERE (name = 'bob');-- ' OR email = '$user') AND pass = '$pass'");

... which selects bob's user row specifically and comments out the password check logic
